# 🎉 Enjoy playing around with the Expanding Cards! 🚀

Hey there! 
I'm **Hariom**👋 Welcome to the **Expanding Cards** project! If you're into cool UI effects, this one's for you. It's super fun and makes your content pop with an interactive twist.

## 🚀 What is this?

This is a simple yet awesome project that creates a set of expanding cards. Click on a card, and watch it come to life! It's perfect for showcasing images, quotes, or just making your website look fancy.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone the repo**:  
   `git clone https://github.com/py-hariom/new-me-1`

2. **Navigate to the folder**:  
   `cd expanding-cards`

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser**:  
   Just double-click on the `index.html` file, and boom! The magic begins.

## 📄 Code Breakdown

### HTML
- Simple structure with a container holding all the cards.
- Each card is a `div` with the class `panel`, containing an `h3` for the title.

### CSS
- All the magic happens here. The `panel` class controls the card's look and feel.
- Flexbox is used for layout, and we have smooth transitions for that cool expanding effect.

### JavaScript
- This little script makes the cards interactive. Click a card, and it expands while the others shrink.

## 🎨 Customization
Feel free to get creative with the styles:

Change the images: Want to use your own images? Just swap out the background-image URLs in the index.html.

html
Copy code
<!-- Change these URLs to your favorite images -->
<div class="panel" style="background-image: url('/images/your-image.jpg')">
Make sure your images are stored in the /images/ folder.

Image files location: All the images you want to use should be placed in the /images/ folder for easy access and organization.

Adjust the sizes: Need bigger or smaller cards? Just tweak the CSS to make it perfect for your project.

Add more cards: Got more content to showcase? No problem! Just add more panel divs in the HTML, and you're good to go.
